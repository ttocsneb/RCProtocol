## About

RC Protocol allows a remote to pair with more than 1 rc device as well as the abillity to connect add-ons: a device that gives the remote more functionality, such as a gimball controller, or a telemetry device.

The Protocol is a library. It does not connect directly to any IO devices other than the tranceiver (RF24L01(+)), and add-ons through iÂ²c.
